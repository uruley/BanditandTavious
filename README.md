# Enhanced Godot 3D Multiplayer Template

This project is an enhanced version of the original [Godot 3D Multiplayer Template](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/3377) developed in Godot Engine 4.3. It builds upon the base template by adding several new features such as room-based multiplayer, proximity chat, and more.

## How to run the project

1. Download or clone this GitHub repository.
2. Open the project in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org).
3. Press <kbd>F5</kbd> or `Run Project`.

<br>

Note: To test multiplayer locally, follow these steps:
Go to `Debug` > `Customize Run Instances`, then enable `Enable Multiple Instances` and set the number of instances to run simultaneously. In this template, the host is not treated as a player.
- The server address is hardcoded to `127.0.0.1` for local testing.


## What Does This Template Offer?

* **Network System:** Includes a basic system for managing client-server connections.
* **Player Setup:** The template allows for adding multiple players to the game, managing their interactions and movement within the 3D environment.
* **Real-Time Synchronization:** Player movements and animations are synchronized in real-time.
* **Player Names Displayed:** Player names are shown above their heads.
* **Player Skin Selection:** Players can now choose from four skins: red, green, blue, or yellow.
* **Global Multiplayer Chat:** A global chat system that allows players to send messages to everyone in the game.
* **Room-Based Multiplayer:** Players can join different rooms, each with its own unique port.
